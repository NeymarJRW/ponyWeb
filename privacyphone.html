        (3) Delete your personal information
        You may delete some of the personal information described in this section ("A) Access to Your Personal
        Information".
        You can ask us to delete your personal information in the following situations.<br>
        1. Dealing with personal information in violation of laws and regulations<br>
        2. If we collect and use your personal information, we will not obtain your explicit consent.<br>
        3. If we process personal information, it is a serious breach of contract.<br>
        4. When you stop using our products or services, or voluntarily cancel your account.<br>
        5. If we no longer provide products or services for you.
        When responding to a removal request, please also notify the organization that obtained the personal information
        and
        delete it promptly, unless otherwise required by law or unless these organizations have obtained independent
        approval. I
        ask you.
        When you delete information from our services, we may not immediately remove the information from the backup
        system, but
        will delete it when we update the backup.<br>
        (4) Automatic determination of the constraint information system Some business functions are based only on
        non-manual
        automatic decision mechanisms (such as information systems and algorithms) to make decisions. If these decisions
        have a
        significant impact on your legal rights, you have the right to ask us to explain that we will file a complaint
        without
        infringing on trade secrets or other user rights or social interests. Provide a way.<br>
        (5) Meeting your requirements For your safety, you may need to provide a written request or otherwise prove your
        identity. You may be asked to verify your identity before processing your request.
        We will respond within 30 days. If you are not satisfied, you can also start a complaint through customer
        service.
        In principle, we will not charge you for your reasonable request, but we will charge a fee for repeated requests
        that
        exceed reasonable limits. Unreasonable duplication, the need for excessive technical means (such as the need to
        develop
        new systems or fundamentally change existing practices), pose a risk to the legal rights of others, or you can
        reject a
        very unrealistic request.
        We are unable to respond to your request as required by law or regulation in the following circumstances:
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Related to national security and national defense security.<br>
        2. Related to public safety, public health and major public interests.<br>
        3. Related to criminal investigation, prosecution, trial and execution of judgments.<br>
        4. There is sufficient evidence to show that the subject of personal information has subjective malice or abuse
        of
        rights.<br>
        Meeting your requirements will seriously damage the legal rights of you or other individuals or organizations.
        Involving trade secrets.
